I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) Pillar at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg) (SUTD). Prior to joining SUTD, I was a Research Fellow in Computer Vision and Robot Perception Lab, Department of Computer Science, [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS). I recieved my Ph.D. in Computer Science from NUS in March 2021, supervised by [Professor Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/). 

I am heading [Intelligent Machine Perception Lab](https://impl2023.github.io) (IMPL) at SUTD, with a primary focus on, but not limited to: 
<!---(1) **Computer Vision**: 3D computer vision, (3D) scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, 3D generation and editing, spatial intelligence. -->
(1) **3D Computer Vision**: 3D scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, 3D generation and editing.
(2) **Machine Learning**: data-efficient learning, multi-modal learning, continual learning, out-of-distribution learning, robust learning.
(3) **Embodied AI**: multi-modal perception, spatial intelligence, embodied navigation, embodied manipulation.
